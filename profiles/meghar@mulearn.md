#### Leadership and Influence:

My journey as a leader has been defined by a commitment to innovation, community impact, and empowering others. Starting as the Deputy Executive Officer of IEDC VISAT, I gained valuable experience in fostering entrepreneurial mindsets, which later propelled me to serve as the Women's Lead, where I championed inclusivity and inspired female students to explore opportunities in technology and innovation. Eventually, as the CEO of IEDC VISAT, I led the successful facilitation of 5 student startups, supervised 7 impactful projects, and elevated our college's ranking in the YIP idea submissions. Beyond entrepreneurship, my role as the Volunteer Secretary of NSS VISAT allowed me to lead community campaigns and relief efforts, promoting social responsibility and collective action. As the Campus Lead of MuLearn, I facilitated peer learning and skill-building initiatives, and as the Placement Cell Secretary, I worked to bridge the gap between students and career opportunities by organizing training programs and placement drives.

Each role has strengthened my leadership, teamwork, and problem-solving skills, shaping me into a versatile and empathetic leader driven to inspire and create meaningful impact.


#### Networking:

I actively seek opportunities to connect with professionals, mentors, and peers in the tech ecosystem. My participation in workshops, hackathons, and events like IEDC SEEDS'97 has allowed me to interact with thought leaders and visionaries, including Mr. Anoop Ambika and Mr. Berjin. Through networking, I aim to not only learn from these experiences but also build long-term relationships that contribute to personal and professional growth.


#### Career Plan:

I aspire to become a full-stack developer with expertise in the MERN stack, enabling me to design, develop, and deploy end-to-end solutions. My short-term goals include mastering back-end development while contributing to open-source projects to enhance my technical skills and industry visibility. Long-term, I aim to work on impactful projects that combine innovation, technology, and design to create meaningful digital experiences.
  

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

Kerala's tech ecosystem is thriving, with a strong emphasis on fostering innovation and entrepreneurship through initiatives like KSUM and IEDC. I see this ecosystem as a catalyst for bridging the gap between local talent and global opportunities. With a focus on sustainability and community-driven projects, I believe Kerala has immense potential to become a hub for cutting-edge technologies and impactful startups.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:

While I have not yet contributed to open-source projects, I am currently in the process of upskilling myself to build the confidence needed to make meaningful contributions. My goal is to engage with the open-source community by contributing to projects aligned with my skills in web development and UI/UX design. This will allow me to give back to the tech community while refining my problem-solving and collaboration skills.


#### History of Community Engagement:

I have been actively involved in various community-driven initiatives, including organizing workshops, hackathons, and ideathons at VISAT Engineering College. These experiences have helped me foster innovation and collaboration among students while enhancing my ability to manage events and bring people together around shared goals.


#### Highly Visible Technical Content:

Although I have not yet published technical content widely, I plan to share my learnings and projects through platforms like Medium, GitHub, and LinkedIn. This will include tutorials, project showcases, and insights into design and development processes, with the goal of inspiring others and growing my personal brand in the tech community.
